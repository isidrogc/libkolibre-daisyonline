#What is Kolibre-daisyonline?

Kolibre-daisyonline is a library built for utilizing the daisy online protocol 
defined by the Daisy Consortium. The library uses defined data structures that 
are populated via methods defined in the daisy online protocol. This allows the
programmer to focus on the goal of the communication, rather than how to create,
send and receive the specific messages.
